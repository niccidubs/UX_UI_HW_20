      <p><strong>Project Dates: </strong>Oct. 7-Nov. 16, 2021</p>
      <p><strong>Tools: </strong>Adobe XD, Miro, InVision, Google Sheets, Google Docs</p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The mission of The United States Department of the Treasury (USDT) is to maintain a strong economy and create
        economic and job opportunities. The agency’s website serves as a portal between people living in the United
        States and the department.
        As a student of the University of Oregon UX/UI Bootcamp, I was tasked to redesign the USDT website. </p>
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>The USDT website contains a myriad of information that people who are not inherently knowledgeable about the
        agency find overwhelming and confusing. </p>
      <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>People who live in the United States need to be able to access the USDT website and feel comfortable navigating
        information so they have confidence in the agency that is at the center of the nation’s economy. By analyzing
        and simplifying the primary navigation of the site as well as placing relevant information at the forefront of
        the home page, visitors to the site are welcomed with information that they can use.</p>

      <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
      <p>My approach for understanding who benefits from the information on the USDT website started with considering
        the American workforce and those who pay taxes.</p>
      <p>I wanted to understand the steps that people take to find information about taxes and tax credits on the
        website as well as information about the national debt.</p>

      <img src="../images/w4Wireflow@2x.png" alt="Locating a W4 Form Wireflow">
      <img src="../images/childTaxCreditWireflow.png" alt="Child Tax Credit Wireflow">
      <p>I identified the steps people would take to accomplish these select tasks. The series of wireflows above show
        the clicks of a user that takes them to the national debt, a W4 form and Child Tax Credit information. This
        helped me understand where people would run into difficulty navigating through the site in search of information
        that has an impact on them.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The people who volunteered to test the site were asked to navigate through the site to locate the pages
        outlined in the wireflows. Here are some comments those peole made during user testing:</p>

      <h3>Data Synthesis and Feature Prioritization</h3>
      <p>In order to focus on keeping the website simple to use for people from all walks of life, I wanted to
        prioritize specific features on the redesigned site. Primarily, I wanted people to feel comfortable as soon as
        they reached the home page. I wanted to find a way to make “Featured Stories” more prominent so that visitors to
        the site have more opportunities to learn about the Treasury Department’s most relevant information.</p>
